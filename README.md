Sri got AEF to go all the way to Jenkins using a Freestyle project and pull down AEF.git.
Chris changed the name of the repo to shared-aef.git and modifed the Jenkins project to continue to work.
Chris is now working on a Jenkins Pipeline project that will do the same thing as the Freestyle project.
